# Sex Artificial Intelligence System

Advanced AI-driven control system implemented in Go.

## System Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

- Core System Management
- Neural Network Processing
- Sensor Integration
- Safety Protocols
- System Diagnostics
- Motion Control
- Behavioral Analysis

## Requirements

- Go 1.20 or higher
- Linux/Unix-based system
- Minimum 8GB RAM
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional but recommended)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/sashalind/sex-artifical-intelligence.git

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Build project
go build ./cmd/sai
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run system with default configuration
./sai

# Run with custom config file
./sai -config=/path/to/config.yaml

# Run in debug mode
./sai -debug
```

## Safety Features

The system implements multiple safety protocols:

- Real-time monitoring
- Emergency shutdown procedures
- Temperature monitoring
- Anomaly detection
- Behavioral constraints
